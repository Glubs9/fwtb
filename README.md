# fwtb
fwtb (forth-with-the-boys) is a forth implementation I am making with my friends

# why is there no documentation?
I will add proper documentation when we get to a proper and mostly stable state              
as of this moment the foundation for the ofrth interpreter is still being written and it would be facetious of me to write proper documentation, please come back a bit later and have a proper peek around!

# design principles
I wanted this to be up to the forth standard but making use of easier to implement implementations (i.e: using structs to describe code rather than real machine code, 
not having all the forth data and information in one block of memory).
