# fwtb
fwtb (forth-with-the-boys) is a forth implementation I am making with my friends

# design principles
I wanted this to be up to the forth standard but making use of easier to implement implementations (i.e: using structs to describe code rather than real machine code, 
not having all the forth data and information in one block of memory).
