# fwtb
fwtb (forth-with-the-boys) is a forth implementation I am making with my friends.

# Why is there no documentation?
I will add proper documentation when we get to a proper and mostly stable state. As of this moment the foundation for the Forth interpreter is still being written and it would be facetious of me to write proper documentation, please come back a bit later and have a proper peek around!

# Design Principles
I wanted this to conform to the Forth standards and make it easier to create implementations of Forth (i.e: using structs to describe code rather than real machine code and not having all the Forth data and information in one block of memory).
