	- there is a suprising similarity between stack and user_code
		- maybe we could implement user_code as a stack and merge the main stack
		and user_code whenever we encounter it, that would kinda work actually
	- add more error messages
		- word not found
		- ...
	- add variables and the like
		- first write create
		- then write ,
	- add macros
		- write immediate (which should just change previous definition node_type to immediate)
	- create a stdlib
		- which defines variable and constant using create macro
	- control flow
		- how
	- handle loading files
	- ????
	- profit / we should be done?
	- build it out to fit the forth standard
